## Notes for this day

### 12:52

Saw a great video by Mylar Melodies, where he has a Roland TR-8 (not the S
variant which I once had) and pairs it with some used multi-effects unit (Zoom B3 I
think) - it drives home the point that you don't need a basement full of gear to
make great stuff - I've got the TR-8s's little brother the TR-6s - which is
basicly the same unit, albeit in a smaller package (less faders and outputs). If
I'm not dead tired tonight, I'm taking it for a session, and not even adding
any external effects, there's tons built-in which I haven't explored. 

I smell a challenge coming, making an EP with just this one box!

It does remind me that thinking back, I produced way more music when it was just
the laptop + a single midi controller. I've had so much access to all these
machines, samplers and synths and it just overwhelms and nothing gets recorded.
