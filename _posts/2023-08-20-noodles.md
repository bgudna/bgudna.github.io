## Notes for this day

### 18:50

I had do re-do most of the setup on the X270 that I had already done, because of
a hard disk upgrade - it was good to actually streamline the setup abit and also
get a massive storage boost at the same time.

Recently saw a project on github called
[Swift-TUI](https://github.com/rensbreur/SwiftTUI) - it will enable me to write
a console application in Swift using SwiftUI to create a NCurses style user
interface. Thinking of same kind of text based simulation type game, very
throwback but using a modern language and tooling.
