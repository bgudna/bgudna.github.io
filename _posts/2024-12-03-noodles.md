## Notes for this day

### 08:41

Going to set up this site as my main online website. Not because I want more
exposure, but since I have the domain and it's not being used for anything -
might as well go for it.

I'm really enjoying the ease of posting, which I do in Vim through the terminal.
I use the same setup across multiple machines, which have the same scripts
symlinked so the workflow stays the same. If I update any of the scripts, all
the machines get the updates, so everything stays consistent.

I've also been thinking about the visuals of the site - I want it to more
resemble my terminal setup, so I'm thinking JetBrains Mono for the text and
gruvbox dark for the colors.

Another thing that's brewing is creating a micro-blog from scratch, using
[ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) - I will need to look into cheap hosting for
that down the line.

Well, now this journal is my main online presence! it's now up and running on
bjorgvingudnason.com - just gotta let all the sweet DNS SSL 24 hour action to
take it's course! 

Now some visual tweaking is really pressing!
