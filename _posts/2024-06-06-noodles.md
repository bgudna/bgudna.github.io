## Notes for this day

### 08:07

I've been learning myself the Swift programming language. Not because I want to specifically have apps up on the Apple AppStore, I just happen to like it and see potential for other uses. A great usecase I saw the other day was using it build Gnome applications.

### 10:22

But I gotta say I'm mildly surprised by the Swift Playgrounds app on the iPad. It looks like Apple is trying to position this as an actual IDE solution, going all the way through development to publishing on the AppStore

So, there will be alot of testing going on, on the iPad - this takes the iPad into a whole other level of productivity!
