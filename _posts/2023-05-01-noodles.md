# Notes for this day

## 16:14

Been thinking about strategies to make myself not so dependent on the services
of device-makers and outsite entities - one thing that makes me reach for the
MacBook Air is the Notes app, it's super handy to slap some notes on the laptop
and they are already to go on the iPhone when I head out.

I once made a notes webapp using the fabled Meteor.js library - that pushed
updates automatically into all views, making it always up to date on any
device.

Will look into recreating it and maybe setting up a Linode instance to run it
on.
