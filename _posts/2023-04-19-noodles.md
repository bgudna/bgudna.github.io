# Notes for this day

## 07:08

Today's Octatrack liveset plan: Finish the track cleanup!

I fixed the floating mouse mouse issue on the x220. Turns out it was the
trackpoint (red button) on the keyboard. Even though I've turned this into a
keyboard only machine, with i3 and vim-keys for everything. It's nice to have at
least the touchpad for some scenarios.

One thing that's been missing from this laptop is Diablo, the original. The
excellent DevilutionX project can be compiled natively on most machines and it's
given this classic game a new lease on life.

Still, the terminal based rogues are the kings!

Added the Bluetooth support for my Major IV headphones on my Arch build. Very
nice indeed.

Before I start progress on the Octatrack, I plan to add this to my system:
 * create a script that generates fullscreen background images on startup.
 * * the images will be in black and white and based on perlin noise
 * set up a hotkey in i3 to generate a new image whenever it's pressed
 * use feh to display the image as a background in i3
 * install picom for some minor transparency effects

System improvements up and running - very happy with the updates, mostly visual
- and at the same time, very low on the resources. So after startup I'm now
  using about 270MB-320MB when the machine is fully booted.
