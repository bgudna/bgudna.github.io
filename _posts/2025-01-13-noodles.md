## Notes for this day

### 09:57

Went to Iceland during the holidays and got married. In a small church just
outside of Borgarnes, a historical location. Everybody showed up and we had a
wonderful time.

Since I got I've been using what little time I have spare to experiment with
designing Quake levels. I've set up build tools so I can iterate pretty quickly
on the level design, I'm mostly aiming for look and feel, not so much fighting
any enemies. I'm using these incredible textures from a developer named Makkon,
and focusing on large concrete stuctures, inspired by Brutalist architecure. I'm
also interested in seeing how far it's possible to go in the storytelling side,
using text in game - like fake messages from other "players" or NPC's.
