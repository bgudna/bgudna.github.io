# Notes for this day

## 17:08

I've set up Audacity on the X270 and will be recording the Octatrack live set
later tonight. Next step on the Octatrack journey will be to set up a project
and make 4-bar loops using the modular and Octatrack, all synced up nice like.
But also keep it flexible and make slices out of the samples and mess around
with them - It's a good way to make sure all samples are created in house.
