## Notes for this day

### 11:08

A reminder regarding banks and parts on the Octatrack: 
Each project has 16 banks, not just 4. Each bank holds 16 patterns, and 4 parts. Each of those 4 parts holds settings for each of the 8 tracks and 16 scenes. So that is 16 patterns per bank, 64 scenes per bank 4 parts per bank
