# Notes for this day

## 15:27

Octatrack + Modular = the key to the goodness. So I've set up a project template
on the Octa that can be used as a basis to quickly get going. Here are some
details:
 * tracks 1-5 are static machines
 * track 6 is a thru machine that takes in the stereo audio from the modular.
 * track 7 is a flex track set to record into audio buffer 7.
 * * this will record 64 steps in a quantized loop.
 * * the recordings can then be saved and used in the static machines on tracks
     1-5
 * track 8 is a master track, with a compressor at the end.
 * * filter effects are set up in scene b on tracks 13+14 (hi-pass + lo-pass)
 * Also set up quick record, so it's a one push to start recording.

Using this setup I can build arrangements into different banks for a whole
massive project that could be performed as a live set.

This will also ensure that I'm not using any sample libraries or other external
samples, everything will be created with the modular.

**for kicks and other single hits, I will record a whole 64 step sample, but
then edit and crop the sample to get a single sample out of it**

Something's fishy with the github actions, stuff ain't being built when I push
... I don't like it!
