## Notes for this day

### 21:34

Just finished a major home improvement project. Built a 30sqm wooden deck
in the backyard. But been thinking about next steps in the creative process -
one angle I'm looking at is making more tracks on just the laptop. I've got
Bitwig running with all my samples loaded on the HD - setting up tracks and the
U-He VST's - Use the modulation features of Bitwig to give things some life.
