## Notes for this day

### 19:18

I've set up a new Ubuntu development machine, quite powerful laptop. Been tweaking the keyboard shortcuts so it works more like the rest of my machines. I still think about what would be the perfect sound source for the Orca sequencer.
I'm going to be experimenting a bit more with that one, so far I've been thinking about:
 * The recreated FastTracker II - if the midi implementation is good, then this might be something. A lightweight host for sounds.
 * Bitwig - probably the way to go.
 * VCVrack - an excellent choice as well

The possibilities are endless for sure.

Oh yeah, and as well - I'm currently the highest bidder on a Macintosh SE/30 - a fixerupper that'll be insane if everything works out!
