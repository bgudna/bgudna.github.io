## Notes for this day

### 08:47

For the untitled Octatrack project, fill the soundpool with sounds and better
match the setting for each bank.

**Reminder:** Get a new battery soon for the X1 Carbon, I get barely 30 minutes
on this current thing and that is with very efficient software running.

I need to find a place in Sweden that sells those little A5 notebooks from MUji.

Current Rogue obsession is [Sil-Q](https://github.com/sil-quirk/sil-q). It's a for of SIL which is a fork of Angband.
Anyway it adds all the Tolkien mythos back into Rogue, for all the right feels

### 09:26

Set up slices for some of the longer samples and use an LFO to randomly select
slice-points. Add some variations of the Amen break to get leaning more from Dub
Techno to Techno Jungle (is that a thing?)

### 14:54

or not really with the jungle thing, at least not for this project. So, sticking
to the process: Do 1 bank item per day, during a week period (this includes 2-4
patterns in a bank) and then use 2-3 evenings to fine tune, then 2-3 evenings
for a test run of the live set. On day 14 the live set is recorded and uploaded
to bandcamp.

### 15:21
