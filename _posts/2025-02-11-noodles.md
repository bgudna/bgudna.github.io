## Notes for this day

### 14:46

Some changes to the setup, I sold the fancy EliteBook that I got. I just
couldn't get along with Windows, the laptop was supernice - but it had a locked
BIOS so I couldn't get Linux on there. So it had to go.

Instead I got a ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen7. Go it up and running in no time with
Pop_OS! and my customizations and apps. Renoise is on here and everything is
ready for Quake mapping.
