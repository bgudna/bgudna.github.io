## Notes for this day

### 17:55

I have set up an efficient way of writing notes without interupting my workflow
in Linux. At any point I can call up a floating window, prepopulated with Vim and
a markdown file, ready to go. I can jot down any note and then, close the window
and resume my work. This is I think is the fastest and most minimal way of getting my notes
online without any kind of mental overhead

### 18:05

I still need to tweak the scss for this site, at least have darkmode by default.

### 18:11

not much left to do but start pushing the latest changes. That'll be the first
update to the repo in 9 years(!).
