## Notes for this day

### 17:24

Going full iCloud backfired totally - wow, what a shitshow - it's completely unusable in any way, shape
or form. Putting this whole thing on ice for now. Getting excited about drawing
again. We have a fantastic pen-tablet screen thing that isn't being used very
much, going to set that up in the studio downstairs for some comic book drawing
sessions. I've let it slip for way to long now. Also, just found out about Dina
Norlund, and she passed away two months ago, an absolute tragedy.

I built a Raspberry Pi into a Macintosh IIci case. It connects to ADB so I can
use the original keyboard and mouse (one button!)
I plan to set this machine up so it boots straight into MacOS 7.6. Probably not
going to get a dedicated screen for it, got no space really. But I'll be able to
use it with any monitor via HDMI so no worries there.

Made a permanent dark mode for the site - finally!
