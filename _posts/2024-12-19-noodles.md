## Notes for this day

### 07:14

Here's an idea, to do a console-like visual novel type game, in Swift + SwiftUI.
I draw all the assets on the iPad. Something like the Phoenix Wright series and
the Detective Conan games on the DS. Multiple branches and drama. Maybe some
interaction/puzzle solving using the touchscreen. Research vintage VN games
(Famicom Detective Club?).

But really, it does make sense to do this kind of stuff in Godot and make sure
it'll run on all platforms. Saw a presentation that Godot4IOS is being worked on
so that could be a way to go one day, to have it on the iPad. 
It's not always doing this in the way that makes sense, it's what inspires you
to get out and do the thing, that makes you want to experiment..
