## Notes for this day

### 11:19

Hooked up the OG Novation Circuit to see how fast I could be to getting it up
and running from the shelf to the audio interface and start recording. Turns out
it was very quick and easy, I just run the thing on batteries so no need to dig
up and find an empty slot for a power supply. I have 8 or 9 projects in there,
ready to go - but it became instantly clear that I need to practice and plan a
little bit before I start recording. At least I have a template saved with all
the mastering and midi settings ready to go.

Managed to "accidentally" buy a new MacBook Pro last night, so there is some
preparations to be done before that arrives - more stuff needs to go from the
workspace. Did manage to snatch some sweat deals as well for some much needed
video game action for December - got RoboCop for the GameBoy! Loved the NES one
as a kid, the music is burned into my DNA. Let's see how this one holds up.

Been getting back into working out and that along with doing this kind of
journalling is helping with getting some focus and quieting the inner noise.
