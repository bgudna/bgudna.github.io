## Notes for this day

### 06:55

Even though I've used Vim for a while now - I'm still curious about Emacs, that
you can set it to "evil mode" aka using Emacs with Vim bindings might be enough
for me to take the plunge. Main reason being Org-mode and the built in project
management features.

**Octatrack status**

I've set up a project on the machine, gotten down some sweet 303 on Machine 5,
and will be populating the whole thing as a live set (45 mins-ish)
 * patterns (and parts for each pattern) are different sections of "songs"
 * banks are new "songs" that hold different patterns and sounds
 * the live set is then a performance of tweaking parameters, muting and
   switching between patterns and banks.
 * I still need to set up different FX with the crossfaders and layers, that
   will need a bit of planning (and masking tape on the machine for reminding me
   of what's what)
