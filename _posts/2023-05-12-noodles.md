## Notes for this day

### 07:02

I switched out the screen in the X270 and oh my what a difference this makes!
The resolution and the deep colors, an incredible improvement, this is now my
main machine on all fronts - I'll selling of more my old ones soon.

There will also be changes coming up in how I do email and backups - At least
set up email forwarding for a certain "free" email service that has been data
mining my personal mail of about 15 years.

The backup will be a tricky to move around but I just need to carve out the time
and actually do it.

### 15:54

I've started the process of moving files over. Once I get everything I want from
the G drive, I'll do a local copy and then I'll push everything over to the new
service. While all that is going on I'll be setting up the email forwarding to
get my email into a secure environment.

looking into the midi controller option for Octatrak and also the Analog4 - this
thing looks like it's exactly what I need! [Shik midi
