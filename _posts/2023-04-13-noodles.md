## Notes for this day

### 07:27

Testing switching from Vim to NeoVim - going to try these from zero to IDE
scripts. If this works out well, I'll do the same on all machines.

However, a planned Octatrack session is happening to night, with the newly
installed single cycle waveforms.

### 16:33

A new tracker has just been announced by Polyend. I think I'll stick with my OG
one and keep at it! Another tracker related item: need to source a Teensy board
and try out running the Dirtywave m8 in headless mode

## 18:00

Already starting work on the single cycle waveforms on the Octatrack - this is a
good way to get some instant 303 basslines. As a reminder:
 * load up a saw wave
 * in playback mode, turn on loop
 * in amp, turn down hold and release (set to about 80)
 * in the filter play around with Q
 * * also in the filter, turn 24db low pass filter and crank up the distortion
 * to turn change pattern length per step, exit recording mode and select
   function + bank
 * to turn on slides (for the sweet 303 accents) select function + bank in
   recording mode
