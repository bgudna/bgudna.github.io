## Notes for this day

### 20:45

Been composing alot on the Novation Circuit. So much actually that I went ahead
and got the updated version, the Circuit Tracks. Very happy with these
grooveboxes, and I'm getting so much out of them from the fact that they are
able to run on batteries. To get away from a desk and just sit in a comfy chair
or a couch and zone out while making music, is really incredible. A perfect way
to unwind in the evening.

I'm planning on recording some of these tracks soon, just need to plan each
performance and practice abit - I'd say I've got some solid ten tracks already.
