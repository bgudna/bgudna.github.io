## Notes for this day

### 09:08

Been cutting down on coffee - now it's one cup when I wake up and then one at
the office. From then on it's tea only, keeps the caffeine headache at bay.

Got a bunch of modules up for sale on the auction site, soon they'll all be gone
and I'll have some sweet sweet deskspace for other things. Even though I'm
selling off stuff doesn't mean I'm giving up on audio experiments - it just
means I'm scaling down the physical stuff. I'm going all in on working in a
DAW and on the iPad. It's mostly the iPad that excites me now, with modular and
being able to host multiple instances of synths and effects. Having all that in
a super portable unit with a fantastic battery is unbeatable!

Going to buy AUM soon on the iPad for playing with during the holidays. Another
app that was just released is Solderbox, that one looks like it'll take care of
all my modular needs and more! Already own most of the Moog apps but never
really clicked with them.
