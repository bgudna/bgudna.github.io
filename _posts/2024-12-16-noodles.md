## Notes for this day

### 09:09

A part of the reason for doing this kind of journaling along with cutting down
on the coffee (I still need that first cup in the morning, but after that it's
tea only) is forcefully changing behaviour patterns. And even though it seems on
paper very small and not a big deal, things are feeling different. Less anxiety,
better sleep, better stomach - it's kind of like a snowball effect.

Painted my updated Eurorack setup yesterday, so now it's all-black like God and
Dieter Doepfer intended :D - it's a single row 84hp unit, and it'll have to do.
It's a perfect size on my desk and looks good - now I just need some basic
modules to perfect the thing. I want a usb module to power the external BeatStep
sequencer, but the main thing I need is a filter, that does low-pass and
high-pass. Maybe some multi-functional oscillator thingy, since space is at a
premium.

But no stress on that front, I've got VCVRack to keep me going. I'm planning to
create little ambient machines, that I can tweak with a midi controller.
