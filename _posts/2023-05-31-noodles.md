## Notes for this day

### 14:45

Just got back from a sweet vacation, feeling reeeeeefresshed!
While on the vaycay I got heavily into doing Sudoku in the mornings and
evenings. Could be a nice healthy habit which I'll try to keep up. Doesn't
involve a huge time investment like Chess (though I will be randomly playing and
attempting to improve on that front as well)

Thinking about midi controllers. Want to get some that has enough nobs and
faders to allow me to control specific software. Don't want to spend much on one
though - so a DIY approach is very tempting. Been awhile since I messed around
with hardware projects!
