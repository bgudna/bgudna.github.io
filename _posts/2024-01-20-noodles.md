## Notes for this day

### 20:32

Planning to do complete projects / songs on the Elektron A4, using no samples,
just the 4 tracks of synths and the built in effects (and p-locks of course).
This will be a deep dive into the pattern sequencer as well - which I hope will
follow over to the Octatrack as well. Both machines have full featured tracker
like song modes that are very often overlooked and unused.
