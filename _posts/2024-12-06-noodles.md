## Notes for this day

### 08:41

VCVRack is an incredible piece of software, it has all the basic building blocks
for modular and then tons of interesting (and some open-source as well) modules
in it's library. ALM has been adding their new modules in there (no PAM's
though) and of course there is the incredible Mutable Instruments lineup.

For focus-based "music to work by" I want to set up some semi-generative
evolving ambient patches that I can steer with a midi controller.

I never thought I would say this, but WSL2 on Windows11 is pretty damn sweet. I
get all the Linux I need and it works seemlessly with the Windows on top, as in
I can run Windows binaries from the WSL terminal (say opening articles in
Windows Firefox from WSL Newsboat and the same with opening videos in MPV). It
might be because the laptop I got is quite nice (got it for a steal too,
probably was stolen! :|) and everything runs buttery smooth and quiet. Battery
lasts forever too.
