## Notes for this day

### 08:37

I need to set some rules for myself for the evening work. The other day I
noticed that I wasn't as burned out in the evenings as I used to be, I attribute
that to me cutting out coffee. But, as I'm feelingn quite relaxed in the
evenings, I need to plan better for what I want to use this free time. There are
tons of things on the backburner that I should be working on, and not just going
down a youtube rabbit hole of whatever happened to the Hellraiser franchise!

I told myself I would write 750 words a day on here, but I don't think I've ever
come close to that. But the routine will be kept and hopefully there will be
improvements.

Another rabbit hole I've fallen into, is checking out these purpose built
computers called "Writer deck" - it's kind of an extension of the typewriter
concept but it's a small Linux computer, sometimes with an E-ink display and
minimal writing tools for distraction free writing. I love the idea of this, but
I would probably never use it.
