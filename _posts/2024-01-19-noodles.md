## Notes for this day

### 15:31

A new year, new things to try and new things to discover.
I have discovered that trying to be creative in the evenings is now almost
impossible. Your basically to tired to anything - so a some new planning is
needed if I want to accomplish / finish any of the million projects I start.

I will start to list these as I get more in the habit of writing. Which in
itself is a part of the goal, to sit down more often and write. I have ideas and
projects where programming and prose writing interject.
