# Notes for this day

## 06:47

Project idea - use the GBA Stepper in an emulator, create loops and record the
output, cut those up into smaller samples, load up into the Octatrack and then
slice it all up to make some sweet sweet chiptunes on the Octa.

Still haven't recorded the so-called liveset but I did experiment with recording
on Linux, going straigt from the Octa into a small USB soundcard.

Still excited about coding up the replacement for the Notes app - feel like I
need to get this done sooner than later.
