## Notes for this day

### 09:02

researching development of modules for VCV Rack - instead of making hardware
Eurorack modules, let's see if I can make some virtual ones instead!

Planning on building a new Eurorack case, that I can use to take on the road,
something like a 2x50HP, a nice square format.

Been selling off some modules from the current case, going to be slowly
rebuilding the setup in the coming months. Need oscillators and a looper in
there. I'm set with samples and effects.
