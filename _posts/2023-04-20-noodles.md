# Notes for this day

## 15:42

I've got prior engagements tonight so I'll have to squeeze in the Octatrack
sessions earlier (if I'm going to work on the project at all today)

Another sidequest I'll be tackling shortly is installing Asai Linux on the M1
Macbook Air. I love the hardware but I'm reluctant to use it because of
increased telemetric monitoring that's been added to MacOS in recent years, it's
a worrying trend that I despise. So much that I prefer to use this laptop, which  more than 10 years older but is still going strong and very much upgradeable. Unlike the MBA with it's built in obsolesence
