## Notes for this day

### 10:59

First day without coffee. Practicing patience and mindfulness. I thought about
diving into module programming for VCVRack, Seems like the perfect sweetspot
between graphics/visuals, programming and electronic music.

A major issue came up with the 2016 MacBook Pro - I now am experienced in the
wonders of Flexgate (as in Apple used a ribbon cable for the screen that is
unable to withstand the constant opening and closing of the lid, and it results
in cracks on the cable, killing the backlight). Been looking at DIY solutions to
the issue, might try it if it bothers me, but probably wont, the battery isn't
great to begin with - so now it's living permanently on my desk, plugged into
a dock with a keyboard, mouse and screen. It's been transformed, as if by magic,
into a Mac Mini. Amazingly, earlier in the day, I had installed the latest
version of Seguoia on it - and incredibly it runs great. So much for outdated
hardware.
