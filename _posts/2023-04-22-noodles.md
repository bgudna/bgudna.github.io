# Notes for this day

## 08:33

Been doing some listening and thinking on the Octatrack live set project, I need
to strip it down, keep it simple, fewer sounds playing at the same time.
Stopping myself from starting to looking into other projects, I might have the
next one lined up: A live set with the RD-6 and Analog4 (2 basslines & 2 leads)
