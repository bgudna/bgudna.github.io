## Notes for this day

### 09:59

I have been making progress in my Quake mapping efforts, really starting to get
the hang of this and alot of ideas are flowing in. The final goal here is to
make one map that is of the level of quality that I can release it on some
modding sites. I want it to be like an escape room thing, and on easy difficulty
there will be no enemies. On other difficulties I'll add something to shoot
(want to explore custom enemy types, but still try to keep the scope of this
small).

I've also started working on an EP, that will be my instrumental punk album. So
far I've done drum tracks for one song, this week I'll try to finish of the
basslines. The plan is to keep going if I can make at least one song that makes
sense and comes close to what I have in my head. Dream would be if I can do 3
songs and then I'll release it as an EP on archive.org.

One other sideproject that I really want to finish off this year, is to make an
interactive fiction game - in the style of Infocom, with a dash of Andrew
Plotkin. I just read a fantasic interview with Andrew by the Digital
Antiquarian, highly recommended.
