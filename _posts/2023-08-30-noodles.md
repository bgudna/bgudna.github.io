## Notes for this day

# 17:10

Didn't keep up with the Suduku training, a damn shame! But still, good to know
it's there. I've started to work on a gaming collection/progress-tracking web application - mostly in order to test out some new frameworks and JS tricks.

I've been meaning to get back into a few games I'm in process of playing
through. Did a deep dive recently into visual novel type games and found a fan
translation of a Japan-only 'Case Closed' game (aka detective Conan) - being a
fan of point and click games (and also text-based interactive fiction) this game
is perfect for what I'm looking for.

Might have a go at creating a similar type of game at some point, add that to
the backlog along with all the other things! :D
