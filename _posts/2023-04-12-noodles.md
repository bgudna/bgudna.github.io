## Notes for this day

### 07:02

Having more creativity focused tools in the everyday, things to help with the
process - like:
 * notebook / sketchbook
 * 3 sharpies of different sizes
 * a favourite camera
 * the [polyend tracker](https://polyend.com/tracker/)
 * a small/light Thinkpad (like the x220 or the X1 Carbon)

### 22:32

Need to load up the adventure-kid waveform collection into the Octatrack.
Experiment with single-cycle waveforms for bass and leads. Use samples for drums
and texture

### 22:39

At some point I will need to make a list of active projects and pin to the menu
section of the site. Should be a part of the focus forcing aspect.
