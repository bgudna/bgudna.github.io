## Notes for this day

### 11:58

I've been off coffee for a while now, and it feels great. The whole reason for
dropping it, apart from the physical benefits, and the most important to me
reason, is the freedom of not being addicted to it! That is a great feeling!

I've been doing some Xcode development these last few days, exploring the Metal
graphics framework. I've always admired Jeff Minter and the Llamasoft stuff, I
want to try to do something using only vectors and shaders, as close to the GPU
as possible, while injecting it with personality. Plenty of dots moving fast and
shooting everything in sight.
