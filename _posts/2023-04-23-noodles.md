# Notes for this day

## 07:52

Accidentally bid on a Thinkpad x270 and got it for a sweet price! So there's
gonna be some more development machine setup coming in the next few days.

Spent yesterday doing yardwork, as the sun was out. Had a book on Lovecraft out
for some breaktime reading, got me thinking about how to proceed with momentum.
Since his books are in the public domain, a straight up adaption could be the
way to go.
