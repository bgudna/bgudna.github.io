## Notes for this day

### 07:06

So I've set up this new (to me) X270 - went with Arch + Gnome. The resolution
wasn't good so I've ordered a matte full HD screen for it. 

Since setting it up I haven't made any progress on the Octatrack live set. I
will be firing it up at some point today though. It's actually not a bad idea to
put it away for a while and come back to it with fresh ears. There will be
tweaking done for sure!

Just gotta make sure you don't let it sit for too long and don't end up tweaking
it constantly so it'll never be completed.

### 19:44

Tonight would be a perfect candidate for doing a modular patch. I've got some
ideas that I want to explore. Also, I got tickets to see [Aphex
Twin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphex_Twin) in June!
