# Notes for this day

## 18:05

So for the Octatrack live set, there's a new plan. Not use any of the stuff I've
done so far. Create a new template, and set up all parameters and scenes so I
have a global setting for all banks (on the crossfader) - biggest thing og all
to set up is the live looping of the Octa output so I can use the crossfader to
switch between banks much smoother - because from the sessions I've had so far,
I'm gonna have to get a separate midi faderbox (faderfox?!) to be able to
perform smoothly.
