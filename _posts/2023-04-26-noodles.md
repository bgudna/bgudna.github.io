# Notes for this day

## 14:27

Created another patch last night and recorded a session. Didn't quite capture
the feeling I had going when I was patching, so it will be scrapped.

Instead of continuing with the modular experiments, I'm regrouping my efforts
and focusing back on the Octatrack - the live set project must have higher
priority so it can be finished and done with. I found an old notebook with a
bunch of titles and namings I came up with while working on other music project,
I'll source a name for the thing from that.

But as soon as I'm done with it, I'm going full force into modular again.
Planning both a longform piece with hardware and also a album style thing with
vcv rack. I will work on the later using github, create a separate repo for each
"album" and version-control the rackfiles in there.
