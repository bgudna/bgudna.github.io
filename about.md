A father of three with artistic tendencies and an unstoppable hunger for
learning and no time to persue new things. Therefore I need a place to quickly
post things to keep focus.

### More Information

A place to store notes and snippets of anything that pops into my head while
using any one of my development machines. This can be related to coding,
painting, photography, music (making and listening), movies and writers.
Something to motivate me to continue to work on projects and also to store any
idea or feeling, for later inspection.
