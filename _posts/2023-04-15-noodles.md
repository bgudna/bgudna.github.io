## Notes for this day

### 08:11

So far I've added 3 stems for possible sections (could be called songs) for a
live set on the Octatrack. I feel I need to add 3 more and then go back, clean up what I already
have and make it feel cohesive. After having looked at Parts, I'll probably not
be using that as much as I originally thought.

Gotta say though, I'm itching to take out the Tracker again, still have a need
to blast out some intense Jungle - it's too much fun.
