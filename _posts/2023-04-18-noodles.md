# Notes for this day

## 07:22

So I'm officially behind on the bank (songs) output, I moved the Octatrack from
the kitchen into my office - so now that it's not in front of me when I'm not
working I forget about it - out of sight, out of mind. So later today it's
coming back up!

I did however set up a new Thinkpad (an x220, my all time favourite), it mirrors the look and workflow I've set up with ArchLinux and i3 on the X1 Carbon. Super happy with it, it's now my daily driver.

I've updated some scripts for this notetaking process - makes it easier to push
updated with a keyboard shortcut. Did this on the x220 - will do the same on the
X1 and the M1 Air.

The Octatrack is back on the desk and ready to go!

So I've got 5 banks and a bunch of patterns in each one, fine for now. Next
steps:
 * set up effects for use with the crossfader
 * * one of these possibly a recording buffer for track 8, for smoother sliding
     between banks (live internal sampling)
 * go over each bank and fine tune
 * * at least in the earlier ones, there missing a bit of the ambience (or
     textures)
 * mix the audio better as well

Steps after that:
 * set up a project in Bitwig with mastering and eq
 * record a live set!
