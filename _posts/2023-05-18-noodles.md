## Notes for this day

### 20:06

I've listed the MacBook Air for sale and it's already confirmed going out. So
from now on it's full time Arch Linux! Feel so damn good!

Also at the halfway point of transferring all backups to a more secure space.
Not saying it's perfect, but it's certainly better than what I had before!

I've been working on doing tests with audio servers and audio routings to get
the lowest latency possible in Bitwig on Linux. Learned alot and have really
gotten it working smoothly. If you are experiencing pops and clicks in your
audio then for sure that's your problem right there.
