## Notes for this day

### 15:03

When I originally set up the X1 Carbon with Arch, I had the home folder on a separate partition. That was a mistake as it wasn't very big, all the stuff I was pulling down was rapidly filling up the space on the partition. So I nuked it and went with PopOS instead - it's actually not that memory intensive when you remove the appcenter/PopShop. I'm very constrained with memory on this machine (only 4GB, soldered!) - but I enjoy the feel of the machine so I'm going to keep using it.

I've been really feeling the urge to get into making some ambient again - I'll be doing some VCVrack stuff in the evenings now - the goal to get an album out in the fall and slap it up on bandcamp.
