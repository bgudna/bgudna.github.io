## Notes for this day

### 07:27

Testing switching from Vim to NeoVim - going to try these from zero to IDE
scripts. If this works out well, I'll do the same on all machines.

However, a planned Octatrack session is happening to night, with the newly
installed single cycle waveforms.

### 16:33

A new tracker has just been announced by Polyend. I think I'll stick with my OG
one and keep at it! Another tracker related item: need to source a Teensy board
and try out running the Dirtywave m8 in headless mode
