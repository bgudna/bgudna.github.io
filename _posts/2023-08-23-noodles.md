# Notes for this day

## 15:53

Thinking alot about Roguelikes these days. Been playing some of my faves,
'Sil-Q' and 'Angband'. These can be played in the terminal, quick and easy.
Should start a repo to work on a browser based version of a similar type of
game. From scratch, use ROT.js and React perhaps?
