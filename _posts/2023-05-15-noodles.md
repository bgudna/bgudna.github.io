## Notes for this day

### 16:10

Hot damn the laptop is feeling damn fine! The screen installation went great and
this is like a brand new machine. I sold the M1 Mac Mini, all went
smooth. Next up will be the M1 Macbook Air - still going to wait a while though,
just in case something comes up and I'll need it :S

Got a dirt cheap office machine to replace the Mini - Bitwig is running great,
though I am going to run through some checklist in setting up Pro Audio on it,
in regards to latency and stuff.

I'll be needing to look into using iCloud on Linux though, to mount the drive
locally and such fun things.

It does feel nice to be cutting ties with these lock in ecosystems ...
