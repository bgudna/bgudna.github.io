## Notes for this day

### 09:00

The site is now up and running mostly as I would like to have it, the domain
change is done and I've got it running secure as well. The visual side is also
mostly complete, although this will be in constant state of improvements here
and there - I can't help myself!

There are a lot of new and exciting modules out for VCVrack - the next step in
the cleanout journey is to sell off the rest of the modules, along with the case
and go all in on doing everything on the laptop. I have a [Github
repo](https://github.com/bgudna/refactored-dollop) which will contain all track
setups in VCVRack (and any other software I can think of using, like
[Sunvox](https://warmplace.ru/soft/sunvox/))

As much as the idea of music making excites me, it's strange that I'm unable to
sit down and actually produce anything. Too much setup and not being able to
just sit down, press record and just get going.

### 10:50

Looking at Gameboy development for a while now, there is a great tool out that
is making it easy to create new things for the machine. There's something about
the combination of form factor and synth chip in this thing that really clicks.
Have been exploring visual novel type games for the GB, that seems like the
direction I would like to go. Many of these VN games were never released in the
West but have since been translated by fans - like the Detective Conan series.
