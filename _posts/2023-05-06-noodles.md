# Notes for this day

## 09:01

Started setting up the Meteor.js stuff for setting up the notes thing. Stunned by how bloated this monster framework actually is - will look at other ways of doing this.

## 09:29

I'll be using Vue.js for sure for this thing.

## 14:20

Also, I'll be selling my M1 Mac Mini soon, tonight it'll be factory restored.
This means I'll be going all in on the recording in Bitwig on Linux. No turning
back!
