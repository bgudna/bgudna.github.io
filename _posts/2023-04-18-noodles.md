# Notes for this day

## 07:22

So I'm officially behind on the bank (songs) output, I moved the Octatrack from
the kitchen into my office - so now that it's not in front of me when I'm not
working I forget about it - out of sight, out of mind. So later today it's
coming back up!

I did however set up a new Thinkpad (an x220, my all time favourite), it mirrors the look and workflow I've set up with ArchLinux and i3 on the X1 Carbon. Super happy with it, it's now my daily driver.
