## Notes for this day

### 18:53

Was going through the tracks I set up on the OG Novation Circuit, and I really did have some nice stuff on there - It's good to have a single device to focus on. I've found that having a whole bunch of hardware, all connected together will very quickly overload you with options and stop the freeflowing creativity (unless you have some single purpose machines, that can be super fun, creative and can get you going fast!)

Anyway, the tracks on the Novation Circuit will need some tweaking, and then it's on to practice performing them. When I've got a good handle on each, I'll record them into Bitwig and put together an album. It's been way too long.
