## Notes for this day

### 09:14

Got a request to buy my OG Circuit, accepted so that's going out now. One less
thing to work with, less clutter and more focus. Point is I can do all the
things the Circuit can do with a laptop, and even more of course. A huge point
of having a standalone unit is that means your away from the computer, which
means less distractions - there's also limited tracks to work with and the same
synth engine which means the sound will be a bit same-y. Limitation breeds
creativity however.

I made custom rack yesterday for my modules, out of wood, on my birthday no
less! I'm now down to a single row of modules, so going forward I'll be planning
how I can optimize the space while getting the results I need. The center piece
of the thing is already in place, which is the incredible Grone Drone from
Malekko Labs - it's a four oscillator drone generator, which sounds amazing,
like being on an alien spaceship - All in a single module. Pure bliss.
