## Notes for this day

### 11:08

fixing the bash-script, using bin/bash instead of bin/sh - was causing problems with the random number generation used in the permalinks.

my preferred commandline youtube utility has stopped updating - I have the source though, will set up a repo and attempt to maintain it going forward.

currently focusing on the Elektron Analog 4 - getting better/faster at setting up kits and starting new sessions. aiming to record more and getting it online for future-proofing.
