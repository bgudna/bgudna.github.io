## Notes for this day

### 08:30

I've been getting rid of soooo much stuff lately in an effort to get more focus
and direction with my projects. Even sold the Octatrack!
I have the Circuits left plus most of the modular and the great tr-6s drum
machine - jeez, even when I write this it feels like I still have too much. 

The point of selling the Octatrack was because I feel I can do the exact same
things with [Renoise](https://www.renoise.com/)

I also dusted off the Gameboys (DMG) that I have, for getting back into LSDJ. Of
course I have too many of these as well, but the only difference between those
is visual (I might sell off a few of these :S)

I'm going to add a reminder to myself to write here daily, thinking early, while
I have my morning coffee. It feels good doing it.


### 09:47

I'm going to take this journalling more seriously from now on. I'm going to
update the styling of it and getting a custom domain! I'll be brainstorming
URL's in the coming days - needs to be something special :P
