## Notes for this day

### 06:55

There's a nice application called
[Shortwave](https://flathub.org/apps/de.haeckerfelix.Shortwave), it plays online radiostation from
all over. It's part of the Gnome Circle apps so it works, looks and feels
perfectly at home on Gnome. I use that to stream SomaFM.

I have been following the development of Cosmic OS, on my x220 I have an Arch
installation that has the latest release in it's AUR. Been a while since I ran
an update to see what's new, and if it's getting closer to the experience that I
have with PopOS. My perfect set up would be if System76 would have just
continued to use Gnome, with their tweaks on top.

Saw this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvVR2iZAYc4&t=695s) the other
day, with the fantastic Captain Pikant. He has some good tips for drum machines,
and uses the TR-6s in the video. Which reminded me how great it is, and that I
need to spend more time with it. I need to get back in to experiments with long
form dub techno.
