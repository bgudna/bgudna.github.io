## Notes for this day

### 18:22

I watched a lecture by [Devine Lu
Linvega] (https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/devlog.html) about virtual machines, portable
focused computing and digital preservation. Super interesting and I'm currently deep-diving into the [UXN] (https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/roms.html) computer and the Hundred Rabbits ecosystem. 

### 18:30

Also been listening to Wes Montogomery, streaming concerts, loving it!
When I see genius like this it makes me want to play. What an incredible style
and music, just beautiful.
